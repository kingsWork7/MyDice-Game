This project is a **browser-based Dice Game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It is an interactive two-player game where users take turns rolling a dice, collecting points, and racing to reach the winning score. The game demonstrates key JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event listeners, conditional logic, and game state management.

## 🕹️ How the Game Works

### **1. Players take turns**
- Player 1 starts as the default active player.

### **2. Roll the Dice (🎲 Roll button)**
- A random number **1–6** is generated.
- The dice image updates on screen.
- If the roll is **not 1**, the number is added to the **current score**.
- If the roll **is 1**, the current score resets to 0 and the turn switches to the other player.

### **3. Hold the Score (📥 Hold button)**
- Adds the player's current score to their **total score**.
- If a player reaches **20 points**, they win the game.
- Otherwise, the turn switches to the other player.

### **4. New Game (🔄 New Game button)**
- Resets all scores  
- Resets player states  
- Hides the dice  
- Restarts gameplay from Player 1
